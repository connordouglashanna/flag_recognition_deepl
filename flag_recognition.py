# baby's first independent deepl project

# for image processing I know the following three libraries are related but
# I'm not sure which does what... 

## protip from Reid: 
    # pytorch dataset class

# pillow
# skimage
# numpy.ndarrays

## steps for each:

# crop to specified aspect ratio

# shrink to appropriate size for nn
# use pillow resize() method

# normalize images

# dimensionality reduction?
